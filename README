IO-Async-Loop-AnyEvent2-ElectricBoogaloo

load IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent

INSTALLATION

Normally you'd use a CPAN client such as cpan or cpanm:

  % cpan IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent2::ElectricBoogaloo
  - or -
  % cpanm IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent2::ElectricBoogaloo

This will likely fail because one of the prerequisites (AnyEvent) is
sabotaging the other (IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent).

The workaround: Install IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent without running its
tests first:

  % cpan -T IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent 
  - or -
  % cpanm --notest IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent

After that, this module should build and install without problems.

To install it manually, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
